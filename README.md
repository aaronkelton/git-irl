Open curriculum to teach Git and GitHub using real world objects.

I've read some blogs, taken some free online courses, and even dabbled with a small team. I still don't fully understand what's going on behind the scenes with Git and GitHub. This is my attempt at building some curriculum that I plan to use to teach myself and others (in the process hereof) all the git things.

**This is git in real life.**
